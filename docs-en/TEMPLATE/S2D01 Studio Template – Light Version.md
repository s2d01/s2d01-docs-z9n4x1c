# Character

- Very light (few Aux).  
    
- Perfect for _fast sketches_ and quick work.  
    
- You can always manually add a send to a Reverb or Texture if you need it at that time.

-> So you have two worlds ready:

- **Template Full** → for full sessions with all routing and FX.  
    
- **Template Light** → for quick composition and fast workflow.
