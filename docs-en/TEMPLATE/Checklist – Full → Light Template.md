# Checklist: from Full → Light Template

### 1. Disable Aux FX.

- In the Mixer, locate the Aux:
    - `Bus Reverbs Ambient`
        
    - `Bus Textures Shimmer`
        
    - `Bus Textures Extra-Dark`
        
    - `Bus Vox TripHopAmbient`
        
- Send all plugins to **Bypass** (⌘+B for quick toggle).  
    
- Alternatively, right-click → **Deactivate Channel Strip** (lighter still).  
    

---

### 2. Remove Send

- Go to **Bus Drums**.  
    
- Turn off sends to FX buses (or turn them down to -∞).  
    **This way the signal goes straight back without extra passes.  
    

---

### 3. Check the Master

- Stereo Out remains unchanged (Ambient or Punchy).  
    
- If you used heavy chains, consider turning them off to work "dry" and light.  
    

---

### 4. Save as Template Light

- Go to **File → Save As Template...**
    
- Name: _S2D01 Studio Template LIGHT_.

# Result

- The project remains with:
    - SD3 Multi-Out
        
    - Bus Drums
        
    - Master Out
        -> No active Aux FX = lighter session, fast workflow.
