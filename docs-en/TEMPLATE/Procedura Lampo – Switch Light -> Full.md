# Lightning Procedure - Switch Light / Full

### 1. Recall/Add Bus FX on the fly.

1. Go to the Mixer → select the **Bus Drums**.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+N** (shortcut: _Create New Aux_).  
    -> Logic immediately creates you a free Aux connected as Send.
3. Choose the right Bus (20, 21, etc.) and load your own Channel Strip Setting (e.g. `S2D01_Reverbs_Ambient`).
4. Adjust the Send level with **⌥ + Drag** (alt + drag) → fine movement.
