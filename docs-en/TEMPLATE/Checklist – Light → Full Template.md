# Checklist: from Light → Full Template

### 1. Create Aux FX

- Mixer Menu → _Options → Create New Auxiliary Channel Strips_.  
    
- Name them now:
    - `Bus Reverbs Ambient`
        
    - `Bus Textures Shimmer`
        
    - `Bus Textures Extra-Dark`
        
    - `Bus Vox TripHopAmbient`
        

---

### 2. Load the Channel Strip Settings

- On each Aux open the preset menu (top left of the channel strip).  
    
- Load:
    - `S2D01_Reverbs_Ambient`
        
    - `S2D01_Textures_Shimmer`
        
    - `S2D01_Textures_ExtraDark`
        
    - `S2D01_Vox_TripHopAmbient`
        

---

### 3. Add Send on the Drums Bus

- Go to **Bus Drums (parent)**.  
    
- Activate the sends to the new Aux FX.  
    
- Initial levels: -20 dB (so you don't saturate anything).  
    

---

### 4. Check the Master

- Stereo Out: already with `S2D01_Master_Ambient` or `S2D01_Master_Punchy`.  
    
- If needed, duplicate the channel strip to have both bypass/on versions.  
    

---

### 5. Save the new setup

- Go to **File → Save As Template...**
    
- Name: _S2D01 Studio Template FULL_.  
    

---

-> Now with this checklist you can always start from the **Light Template** and, if you need to, in 2 minutes you are in Full with all the FX buses active.
