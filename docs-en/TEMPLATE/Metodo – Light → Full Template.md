# Method: switch from Template Light → Full

### 1. Start from the Light project.

- You have SD3 Multi-Out + Bus Drums + Master.  
    
- No FX bus loaded.  
    

---

### 2. Recall your saved Channel Strip Settings.

1. **Create new Aux** → Bus 20, 21, 22, etc. (as many as needed).
    
2. On each one load your preset:
    
    - `S2D01_Reverbs_Ambient`.
        
    - `S2D01_Textures_Shimmer`
        
    - `S2D01_Textures_ExtraDark`
        
    - `S2D01_Vox_TripHopAmbient`
        

---

### 3. Add sends on the Drums bus

- Open the channel strip of the **Bus Drums**.  
    
- Activate the sends to the new Aux (Reverbs, Textures, Vox).  
    
- Set initial levels low (-20 dB) and adjust by ear.  
    

---

### 4. Master unchanged

- The Master Out already remains with your setting (Ambient or Punchy).  
    
- No need to redo anything.  
    

---

# Result

- In 3 minutes turn the **Light Template** into **Full Template**.  
    
- You didn't have to re-route SD3 or move tracks.  
    
- It's a modular system:
    -> if you just need a reverb, you just load that.  
    -> if you want the whole architecture, you load all the buses.
