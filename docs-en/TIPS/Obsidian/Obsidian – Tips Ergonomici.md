# Obsidian - Ergonomic Tips

## 1. Quick navigation.
- **Important note pins**: open the note (e.g. `00_INDEX`) and click the thumbtack in the upper right → it always stays fixed.
- **Sidebar ON/OFF**: open/close by clicking icons, or you can assign hotkeys in `Settings → Hotkeys`:
  - Toggle left sidebar = shortcut of your choice
  - Toggle right sidebar = shortcut of your choice

## 2. Minimal formatting in Markdown.
- `# Title` → large title
- `## Subtitle` → medium title
- `- List` → bulleted list
- `[NameNote](NameNote.md)` → link to other note

*(Nothing else is really needed!)*

## 3. Section covers.
For each important folder (e.g., Harmonial, Superior Drummer 3) create a **note-cover page** with the same name.
Inside put links to the subsections:

## 4. Global search
- Use the 🔍 lens on the left to find any text or title right away.
- It saves your life when you remember a detail but not where you wrote it.

## 5. Starred Notes
- You can mark your most used notes as "Starred" (you need the **Starred** core plugin).
- So you always keep DRUMS, MASTER, FX, etc. at hand.

**Golden Rule: *one folder = one main note-cover*.  
The rest are subchapters. That way you never get lost.
