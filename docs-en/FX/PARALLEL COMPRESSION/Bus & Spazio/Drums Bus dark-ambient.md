    - Cut wide -2/-3 dB at 5-6 kHz (darken)
        
2. **Compressor (Studio VCA or Vintage Opto)**

    - Attack: 40-50 ms (slow)
        
    - Release: 150-200 ms (breathe in time)
        
    - Threshold: adjusted to have only 2-3 dB gain reduction (look at center meter)
        ** Battery stays alive, only slightly stuck.
        
3. **Space Designer (short dark room, direct insert)**

    - Dry: 0 dB
        
    - Rev: -18 dB (equals low mix, ~10%)
        ** Dark halo holding the kit together.
        
4. **Optional - Very light chorus (for "sound fog")**
    
    - Rate: 0.2 Hz
        
    - Depth: 10%

## Routing with other buses.

- **Drums Bus** goes straight to Stereo Out.
    
- Light send to your **Parallel Punchy** (to add attack when needed).
    
- Send to **Reverbs Ambient** (especially HH and snare) → so it gets into the soundscape.
    

---

** Result:
Drums Bus becomes **soft, dark, atmospheric** → does not invade but "breathes" in space. Perfect for ambient/downtempo tracks.

## Practical use

- With this setup the battery becomes **softer, velvety and immersed**.
    
- It doesn't foreground, but creates atmosphere → perfect for dark ambient/downtempo tracks.
    
- Mix it with your **Parallel Punchy** if you want some attack coming out.
