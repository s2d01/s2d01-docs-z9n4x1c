# Drums Bus (Parent Stack)

## Recommended Chain (Logic stock)

### 1. **Channel EQ** (general color).

- **Kick area**: a slight boost at **60-70 Hz** (+2 dB, Q wide).
    
- **Snare body**: small lift to **200 Hz** (+1.5 dB).
    
- **Mud cut**: cuts slightly at **250-300 Hz** (-2 dB, medium Q) → reduces "boomy".
    
- **Presence**: +1-2 dB at **3-4 kHz** to give life to snare drum and cymbals.  
    **Beware: don't overdo it, these are subtle tweaks.

### 2. **Compressor** (FET style → 1176 emulation).

- Circuit Type: **Studio FET**
    
- Ratio: 4:1
    
- Attack: **30 ms** (medium, allows bass drum and snare transients to pass through).
    
- Release: **100 ms** (medium-fast, breathe in time).
    
- Gain Reduction: 3-5 dB.  
    ** Gives "glue" without crushing too much → very _Massive Attack_ style: punch but dark.

### 3. **Tape Delay** (only for subtle movement).

- Sync: 1/8 L, 1/16 R
    
- Feedback: 10-15%
    
- Wet: 8-10% (very low, it almost has to "not feel")
    ** This creates you a short stereo delay that gives **amplitude and groove** to hi-hats and percussion.

### 4. **Optional: Exciter or Saturation**

- You can insert the **Exciter** plugin (Logic → Distortion → Exciter) with Amount 5-10% only on the high end (5 kHz-10 kHz).  
    **It gives you a thread of brightness if you hear the kit too dark.

## Routing with other buses.

- **Drums Bus → Stereo Out** (clean, with glue and EQ).
    
- A send to your **Parallel Bus (Super Punchy)**, as you already do, to add bang.
    
- A light send to the **Reverbs Ambient** (especially HH and snare).
    

---

** Result:

- The Drums Bus holds everything together.
    
- The **Parallel** adds punch.
    
- The **Ambient Reverbs** and **Textures** make the drums breathe in space.
