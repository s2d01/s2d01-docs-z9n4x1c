# Bus _Reverbs Ambient_ - double reverberation (Eno style).

---

## 1. Space Designer → Short plate (for presence and body).

- **IR Sample**: Plate Small (choose one "bright" or "dark" to taste)
    
- **Length**: 1.2-1.3s (maximum)
    
- **Pre-Delay**: 20-30 ms → separates direct sound well from reverb
    
- **Internal EQ**:
    
    - High Cut: 5 kHz
        
    - Low Cut: 200 Hz
        
- **Stretch**: 100% (if you want more density you can try 80-90%)
    
- **Dry/Wet Mix**: 100% (you are on Aux)
    
- **Output Level**: 0 dB (manage from the Aux fader in Logic).
    

**Result: a dark, short plate that gives presence without overwhelming.

## 2. ChromaVerb → Long hall (for depth and atmosphere).

- **Algorithm**: Hall
    
- **Decay**: 3-4s
    
- **Pre-Delay**: 40-50 ms (so the tail comes in later and stays "spacey")
    
- **Density**: 80-90% (denser = more "sound cloud")
    
- **Modulation**: Depth 15-20% → "breathing" motion
    
- **EQ (integrated in ChromaVerb)**:
    
    - Low Cut: 200 Hz
        
    - High Cut: 6-7 kHz
        
- **Mix**: 100% (Aux)
    
- **Output Level**: 0 dB
    

**Result: a huge, dark, modulated space that creates the typical "Eno" atmosphere.


## Reverberations / Space (Eno style)

- **Typical chain**:
    
    - Long reverb → _Plate or Hall_ (2-4 sec), filtered with low cut 200 Hz and high cut 5-6 kHz.
        
    - A short **delay (80-120 ms)** before the reverb → adds "pre-space" and keeps the sound from going to the tail immediately.
        
    - **Slow modulation** (very light chorus/phaser or an LFO on the filter) to let the reverb breathe.
        
- **Eno trick**: create _multiple reverbs in parallel_ with different decays (e.g., one short and dark, one long and thin), and blend them. It becomes a soundscape instead of just an effect.
