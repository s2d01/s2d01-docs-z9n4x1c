# Save Channel Strip and/or Patch

## 1. Save as **Channel Strip Setting**.

- Go to the Bus/Aux you want to save (e.g., _Textures_).
    
- At the top of the channel strip, in the **Setting** menu, click **Save Channel Strip Setting As...**.
    
- Give it a name (e.g., _Textures Shimmer_).  
    **This saves the entire effects chain and parameters.  
    When you open another Aux in the future, you can load that chain right away.

## 2. Use a **Project Template**

If you want to always find _all your Aux ready-made_ (Ambient Reverbs, Textures, Drum Parallel, etc.), then:

1. Set up the project with all the buses as you like.
    
2. Go to **File → Save as Template...**.
    
3. When you open Logic, you will immediately find it on the home screen among your custom templates.

💡 Summary:

- **Single aux** → save as _Channel Strip Setting_.
    
- **Complete setup with multiple Aux** → save as _Project Template_.
