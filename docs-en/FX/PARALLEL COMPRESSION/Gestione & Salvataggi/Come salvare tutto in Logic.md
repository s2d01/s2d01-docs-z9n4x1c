# How to save everything in Logic

## Where Logic saves channel strip settings.

- Logic puts the **.cst** (channel strip setting) files in the user folder:
    
    ```
    ~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Channel Strip Settings/
    ```
    
    Inside you will find subfolders for **Audio**, **Instrument**, **Bus**, **Output**.
    
- When you save from Logic → "Save Channel Strip Setting As...," the file ends up there.

## How to create your custom folder.

1. Go to the folder:
    
    ```
    ~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Channel Strip Settings/
    ```
    
2. Inside "Bus" (since yours are Aux/Bus), create a new folder:
    
    ```
    S2D01 Ambient FX
    ```
    
3. Save your settings directly there (when you do _Save As_, Logic allows you to navigate to that folder).

## How you call them up in Logic.

- When you open the **Setting** menu on the channel strip of an Aux, you will see your **S2D01 Ambient FX** folder appear.
    
- Inside will be all your personal presets: _Reverbs Ambient_, _Textures Shimmer_, _Super Punchy Drum Parallel_, etc.
    

** So you no longer have to search randomly through the huge menus: you have a library "branded" for your project.
