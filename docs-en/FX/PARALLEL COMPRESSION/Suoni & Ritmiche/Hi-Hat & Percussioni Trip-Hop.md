**Hi-Hat & Trip-Hop Percussion**
## **Target**
Hi-hat and percussion that **doesn't shine too brightly**, remains **dark, hypnotic and rhythmic**, becoming part of the mood rather than an in-your-face element.

## **1. Hi-Hat (acoustic or electronic)**
- **EQ**:
	- High Cut: 8-10 kHz → no excessive brightness.
	- Slight boost to 2-3 kHz if presence is needed.
- **Processing**:
	- Short Ping-Pong delay (1/16 or 1/8, feedback 10-15%, mix 15-20%) → hypnotic movement.
	- Optional: Light saturation (Overdrive Drive 2 dB, Tone 4-5 kHz).

## **2. Percussion (congas, bongos, various drums)**.
- **EQ**:
	- Low-pass at 6-7 kHz → always dark.
	- A small bump at 200-300 Hz for warmth.
- **Processing**:
	- Slow tremolo (Rate 1/2 or 1/4, Depth 20-30%) → creates a "pulse" effect.
	- Short dark room (Space Designer 0.8-1s, filtered).

## **3. Creative Layering**
- You can add **filtered noises** (vinyl crackle, field recording) in sync with hi-hats → they become part of the groove.
- Optional: **Reverse FX** on single hits → atmospheric transitions.

## **4. Bus Percussion (optional)**
- Collects hi-hats and percussion in a dedicated bus.
- Processing bus:
	- Compressor Opto ratio 2:1, GR max 2 dB → glue.
	- Light saturation → amalgam.
- Generous send to **Reverbs Ambient** → so they blend into the soundscape.

## **Final character**
- Hi-hat and percussion become **hypnotic, dark and soft**, always part of the atmosphere → no pop brilliance.
- Slow, sensual, "smoky" groove → typical Massive Attack trip-hop sound.
