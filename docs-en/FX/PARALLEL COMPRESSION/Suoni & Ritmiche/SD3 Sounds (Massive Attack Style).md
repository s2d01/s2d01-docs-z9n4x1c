# SD3 Sounds (Massive Attack Style)


### Objective.

Drums **dark, heavy, atmospheric**, with soft kick and dry snare, typical of 90s Bristol trip-hop (_Mezzanine_, _100th Window_).

---

### 1. **Choice of kit in SD3**

- Start with a **Ludwig 70s** or **Gretsch** kit (they are already dark and full).
    
- Use few cymbals → dark HH, no bright crashes (or keep them but filtered).
    
- Watch out for **Overheads** and **Room**: they are critical, more so than close-mics.
    

---

### 2. **Routing in SD3**

- Kick → Direct Out (clean).
    
- Snare → Direct Out.
    
- HH and cymbals → turn them down a lot, keep them almost as "background noise".
    
- Room → keep it high, it will be the glue of the kit.
    
- Overheads → turn them down and filter out the highs, so they stay dark.

### 3. **Processing in Logic**

#### Kick

- EQ: cut 250 Hz (-3 dB), boost to 60-70 Hz (+3 dB) → soft sub.
    
- Slow compressor (30-40 ms attack) → let breathe.
    

#### Snare

- EQ: low cut 150 Hz, boost 200 Hz (+2 dB body), slight +3 dB at 2-3 kHz (snap).
    
- Light saturation (Overdrive or Tape Delay trick).
    

#### Hi-Hat / Cymbals

- EQ: low pass 8-10 kHz → no brightness.
    
- Short delay (1/16, low feedback) for movement.
    

#### Room

- Aggressive compressor (FET 1176 style, 8:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release) → characteristic "pump".
    
- EQ: High cut 6 kHz to darken.

### 4. **Bus Drums Processing**

- Parallel compression ("Super Punchy") → adds body and aggression.
    
- Room + Dark Overheads → mix them with the main bus.
    
- Some dark ambient reverb (2-3 s, filtered).
    

---

### Final character

- Deep and dark kick.
    
- Dry snare, with character but not bright.
    
- Compressed room that becomes part of the groove.
    
- Cymbals almost hidden, only as texture.
    
- Dark, hypnotic atmosphere → _Massive Attack mood_.

## Where to look in SD3.

1. **Library Core (Superior Drummer 3 Default Library)**
    
    - The kits recorded by George Massenburg have beautiful, dark rooms.
        
    - Start with a kit like _Ludwig_ or _Gretsch_ and work your way up to processing.
        
2. **EZX/SDX expansions (if you have them or want to get them)**
    
    - **Hip-Hop EZX** → already has kick and snare sampled in trip-hop style.
        
    - **Dark Matter EZX** → cinematic/industrial sounds that lend themselves to dark atmospheres.
        
    - **Electronic EZX** → acoustic-electronic hybrids, useful if you want layering.
        
3. **Practical Trick**
    
    - Get a dark acoustic kit (e.g., Ludwig 70s) → process it with **dark EQ + parallel comp + saturation**.
        
    - Layera kick/snare with an electronic sample (even stock inside SD3) → typical Massive Attack approach.

## Basically.

- You will not find an "Unfinished Sympathy Kit" preset.
    
- But with a dark kit (Ludwig, Gretsch), attenuated overheads, compressed room, and some saturation, you'll get pretty close.
    
- If you want to get straight to the point, **Hip-Hop or Dark Matter expansions** save you time.
