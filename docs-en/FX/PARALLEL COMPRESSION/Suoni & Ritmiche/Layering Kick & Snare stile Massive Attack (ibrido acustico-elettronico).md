**Layering Kick & Snare style Massive Attack (acoustic-electronic hybrid)**

### Objective

To combine the **organic depth** of SD3's acoustic kit with the **controlled beat** of electronic samples → the typical Massive Attack mix (real drums + programmed elements).

---

### 1. **Kick - Acoustic + electronic layer**

- **Acoustic (SD3)**: take Ludwig/Gretsch dark kick → EQ as in #10 (cut 250 Hz, boost 60-70 Hz).
    
- **Electronic**: add a _sample sub-kick_ or "808 tail" (also inside SD3 Electronic EZX if you have it, otherwise any sample).
    
- **Routing**: put the sub-kick in parallel, filter it out:
    
    - Low Pass at 100 Hz (sub only).
        
    - Mix low (10-20%), just enough to fill the bass.
        

** Result: electronic beat under the acoustic body.

### 2. **Snare - Dry layer + texture**

- **Acoustic (SD3)**: dry, filtered and darkened snare (low cut 150 Hz, boost 200 Hz).
    
- **Electronic**: add a clap, or a dark electronic snare sample.
    
- **Routing**:
    
    - Electronic clap/snare → High-pass EQ (above 800 Hz), no low body.
        
    - Mix at 20-30%.
        

** Result: acoustic body + electronic clap = snare more present without getting bright.

---

### 3. **Room & Overhead**

- Keep Room acoustic high, compressed (aggressive pump).
    
- Electronic layers go DRY (no reverb) → so they stay dry and contrast with Room.

### 4. **Bus Drums**

- Glue compressor (VCA 2:1, 2-3 dB GR).
    
- Parallel punch bus to bring out kick/snare.
    
- Light saturation (Overdrive) to blend acoustic + electronic.
    

---

### Final character

- Deep kick with electronic sub below.
    
- Organic snare with electronic "tail".
    
- Dark, compressed room that breathes.
    
- Result → **acoustic/electronic hybrid** in _Massive Attack_ style, ready for downtempo/ambient trip-hop.
