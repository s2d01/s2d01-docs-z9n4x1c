## Rhythms (Massive Attack style)

- **Kick**: soft but huge → EQ digs around 200-300 Hz, boost at 60-70 Hz. Slow compressor lets it "breathe."
    
- **Snare**: dry and dark → low cut below 150 Hz, boost at 200 Hz for body, a touch at 2-3 kHz for snap. Often saturated (tape or tube type).
    
- **Hi-Hat and percussion**: always filtered, never too bright. Often with short **ping-pong delay** (1/8 or 1/16) to give movement without taking up too much space.
    
- **Parallel compression** (Super Punchy Drums) → essential to give punch without losing the slow mood.
