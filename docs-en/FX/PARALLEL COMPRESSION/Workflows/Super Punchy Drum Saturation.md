## Super Punchy Drum Saturation

That chain you made for yourself (_Saturn + Pro-Q4 low cut + 1176_) is exactly the classic **parallel punch bus** approach that serious sound engineers use:

- **Saturn** → it adds harmonics and "grit" to you.
    
- **Pro-Q4** with the low cut below 120 Hz → brilliant, because then you don't mess with the speaker subs (you leave the bass clean on the main bus).
    
- **1176 FET** (ratio 4, attack 3, release 7) → fast, mean compression, perfect for blasting out snare drums and cymbals.
    

Output 15 / Input 33 = nice bang, you're really pushing the machine to get it saturated.

** Two veteran ideas you could add to your "Super Punchy Drum Saturation."

1. **EQ boost mid-highs after the compressor**.
    
    - A 3-5 kHz bell (+2/3 dB) → brings out even more snare drum crack and cymbal attack.
        
2. **A pinch of short/dark reverb only on the parallel**.
    
    - Short plate type (0.7-1s), low mix (10-15%).
        
    - Result: parallel not only pumps, but "widens" in space without kneading.

So you would have:
**Saturn → Pro-Q4 (low cut) → 1176 → (optional) EQ lift → plate reverb dark**.
