# Workflow Eno + Massive Attack - ONLY with Logic effects.

---

## 1. **Bus "Ambient Reverbs "**

Create a dedicated Aux (Bus 20 for example), call it _Reverbs Ambient_.

** **Chain effects (Logic stock):**

1. **Space Designer** (first instance).
    
    - Type: _Plate_
        
    - Length: ~1.2s
        
    - Internal EQ: **High Cut 5 kHz, Low Cut 200 Hz**
        
    - 100% Mix (you are on an Aux)
        
2. **ChromaVerb** (second instance, in series).
    
    - Type: _Hall_
        
    - Decay: 3-4s
        
    - Pre-delay: 30-40 ms
        
    - High Cut: 6 kHz
        
    - Low Cut: 200 Hz
        
    - Modulation: Depth 15-20% → to give "breathing space"
        

** **Use:**

- Snare/HH → send a little (20-30%)
    
- Kick → little to none
    
- Texture → a lot (50-70%)

## 2. **Bus "Textures "**

Dedicated aux (Bus 30), call it _Textures_. Here you send noises, pads, reverse.

** **Chain effects:**

1. **Channel EQ**
    
    - Activates only one **Band-Pass**:
        
        - HPF at 300 Hz
            
        - LPF at 5 kHz
            
    - Result: more "telephone-like" textures, without extremes.
        
2. **Overdrive** (Logic → Distortion → Overdrive).
    
    - Drive: 3-4 dB
        
    - Tone: 4.0
        
    - Output: -2 dB (to compensate)
        ** Simulates Saturn "warm tape".
        
3. **ChromaVerb (Shimmer emulation)**
    
    - Type: _Concert Hall_
        
    - Decay: 5-7s
        
    - Mix 100%
        
    - EQ: High Cut 7 kHz
        
    - Tip: Use the **Pitch** parameter → +12 semitones → shimmer effect.
        

** **Use:**

- Send us pads, field recordings, slow synths.
    
- The result is an atmospheric "veil" that lives behind the kit.

## 3. **Drums Bus (Parent Stack)**

This is the sum of your SD3 auxes.

** **Typical effects:**

1. **Channel EQ**
    
    - Kick: boost 60-70 Hz, cut 250 Hz.
        
    - Snare: boost 200 Hz (body), one touch at 3 kHz (snap).
        
    - HH: LPF around 10 kHz (not too bright).
        

_(you can also do this on individual auxes, but if you want a "color bus" do this)_

2. **Compressor (Logic) → Circuit Type: FET**
    
    - Ratio 4:1
        
    - Attack: 30 ms (medium-slow)
        
    - Release: 100 ms
        
    - Gain Reduction: 3-5 dB
        ** Gives cohesion, but lets the groove breathe.
        
3. **Stereo Delay (for percussion or HH)**
    
    - Sync: 1/8 L, 1/16 R
        
    - Feedback: 15%.
        
    - Mix: 10%
        ** "Trip-hop" movement without covering.

## Final routing

- **Drums Bus** → Stereo Out
    
- **Reverbs Ambient** → Stereo Out
    
- **Textures** → Stereo Out
    **Three main faders to balance to taste.
