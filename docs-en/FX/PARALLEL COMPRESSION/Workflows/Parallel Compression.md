**Parallel compression setup for battery**.

---

## Step 1 - Create the drums bus.

1. In the Logic Mixer select all **Auxes of Superior Drummer** (Kick, Snare, HH, Toms, OH, Room).
    
2. Set their output not to "Stereo Out," but to a **Bus** (e.g., Bus 10).
    
3. Logic creates you a new **Aux (Bus 10)** → rename it "DRUMS BUS."  
    ** Now all the kit goes through there.
    

---

## Step 2 - Duplicate it for parallel.

1. On the **DRUMS BUS**, create a **Send** (e.g., Bus 20).
    
2. Logic opens you a new Aux (Bus 20) → rename it "DRUMS PARALLEL."
    
3. Set the Send to **Pre-fader** and set it to 0 dB.  
    **This way you have a kit clone that does not depend on the volume of the main bus.

## Step 3 - Compress like an animal.

On the **DRUMS PARALLEL** channel:

- Put a nice aggressive compressor (Logic Compressor in _VCA_ or _FET_ mode).
    
- Ratio: 8:1 or 10:1.
    
- Short attack (5-10 ms).
    
- Fast release (50-100 ms).
    
- Threshold so that it "crushes" hard (also 10-15 dB gain reduction).
    

** Result: parallel bus sounds _pumped, fat and present_.

---

## Step 4 - Mix the two worlds.

- Slowly turn up the volume of **DRUMS PARALLEL** below the **DRUMS BUS** clean.
    
- Find the point where the drum "breathes" but at the same time has the most bang.
