## Bonus Ambient/Downtempo

- On the **DRUMS PARALLEL** you can also add a **dark, long reverb** → the result is a kit that stays natural on the main bus but has a full, atmospheric ambient tail on the parallel.
    
- You can even distort it a bit (Saturation / Overdrive) to give it character.

** This is a trick all sound engineers use: from Andy Wallace in rock to people like Brian Eno in ambient (he more with parallel reverbs).
