**Practical workflow in Logic Pro**

---

## STEP 1 - Organization with Dedicated Bus.

1. **Create a "Drums Bus "** → all Aux of SD3 in (already with Stack).
    
2. **Create a "Reverbs Ambient "** → an Aux just for long/dark reverbs.
    
3. **Create a "Textures "** → Bus where you send noises, pads, reverse, etc.
    **This way you immediately separate groove, space and ambience.

## STEP 2 - Bus "Ambient Reverbs"

- Insert **2 different reverbs in series/parallel**:
    
    - **Short dark slate (1.2s)** → high cut at 5 kHz, low cut at 200 Hz.
        
    - **Long hall (3-4s)** → dark filtered, perhaps with a **slow modulator** (chorus/phaser).
        
- You can dose them with different Send: Kick and Snare a little, Hi-Hat and texture a lot.  
    ** You immediately have the "layered space" typical of Eno.

## STEP 3 - "Textures" bus.

- Here you send ambient recordings, synths, reverse FX.
    
- Typical chain:
    
    - Band-pass EQ (300 Hz - 5 kHz).
        
    - Saturator (Saturn with a touch of "Warm Tape").
        
    - Shimmer reverb (pitch +12, 100% mix).  
        ** This bus becomes the **atmospheric spine** behind the groove.
        

---

## STEP 4 - Drums Bus (Massive Attack feel).

- Kick: EQ to free 60-70 Hz, slow compressor.
    
- Snare: parallel compression (use _Super Punchy_).
    
- Percussion: low-pass filter (no excess brightness), short ping-pong delay.  
    ** So you get heavy but dark grooves without getting "techno".
    

---

## STEP 5 - Routing and control.

- Send **Drums Bus → a bit into the Ambient Reverbs** (lots of hi-hat and snare, little kick).
    
- Send **Textures → a lot into the Ambient Reverbs** (so they blend into the space).
    
- Stereo Out → you already have the clean + dark + atmospheric sum.
    

---

-> You end up with three main faders controlling everything:

- **Drums Bus** (energy)
    
- **Reverbs Ambient** (space)
    
- **Textures** (atmosphere)

# How to use them together

- **Snare and HH** → a little bit of Plate (for attack) + a touch of Hall (for tail)
    
- **Kick** → very little Plate, almost no Hall
    
- **Texture and pad** → mostly long Hall, little Plate
    
- **Environments and reverse FX** → 100% Hall to create "soundscapes"
