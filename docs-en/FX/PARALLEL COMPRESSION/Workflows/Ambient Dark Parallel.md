## **Ambient/Dark Parallel**

> Objective: depth, movement, dark and enveloping atmosphere.

**Recommended chain:**

1. **Compressor OTT (or Logic Multipressor in 3-band mode)**
    
    - compresses a lot on treble, medium-light on bass.
        
    - Is used to make cymbals velvety and let transients breathe.
        
2. **Dark EQ**
    
    - cuts above 10-12 kHz, soft roll-off.
        
    - Small enhancement at 400-500 Hz (+2 dB) to give body.
        
3. **Tape Saturation / Decapitator in "Tape" mode.
    
    - little drive, just to "fog".
        
4. **Reverb long and dark** (2-3 sec, plate or hall filtered).
    
    - Mix 100% (if you use it only on parallel).
        
    - Low cut at 200 Hz, high cut at 5-6 kHz.  
        ** Mix very softly in the mix: it's like a "sound veil" that gives depth.
