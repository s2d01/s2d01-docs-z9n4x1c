## **Punch Electronics/Modern**

> Goal: Club beat, aggressive thrust that makes subwoofers dance.

**Recommended chain:**

1. **Transient Designer**
    
    - Attack +30%, Sustain -20%.
        
    - Kick and snare puncture immediately.
        
2. **1176 "All-Buttons-In "** style.
    
    - Ratio on 20:1, Attack medium, Release fast.
        
    - Compression that musically crushes and distorts.
        
3. **Surgical EQ**
    
    - Boost +4/5 dB at 60-80 Hz (kick thump).
        
    - Boost +4 dB at 3-4 kHz (snap snare/platters).
        
4. **Analog/ Saturn distortion in Warm Tube mode**.
    
    - Mid-high drive, 50% mix.  
        **Higher mix than clean bus: this parallel _becomes_ part of the sound, not just seasoning.

### Basically:

- **Ambient/Dark** → colors the space, adds atmosphere.
    
- **Electronic punch** → adds violence and presence.
    
- **Super Punchy Drum Saturation** (your own) → remains the perfect middle ground for rock/organic downtempo.
