## Texture / Ambient layers

- **Granular or shimmer reverb**: take a pad or piano note, send it into a shimmer reverb with pitch +12 → it becomes an atmospheric carpet that moves.
    
- **Noise layers**: ambient recordings (wind, road, rustling) filtered in tight band-pass → give that "dirty" feel that Massive Attack used in the backgrounds.
    
- **Reverse FX**: reverbs or delays rendered, then reversed, put to fill in between hits. Super "cinematic trip-hop."

** Result:

- Slow, warm, dark rhythm section → _Massive Attack_.
    
- Endless spaces and breathing textures → _Brian Eno_.
    
- Together = your signature dark/ambient/downtempo sound.
