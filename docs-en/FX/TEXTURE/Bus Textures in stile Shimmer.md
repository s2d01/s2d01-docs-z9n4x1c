# Bus Textures in the style of :Shimmer"
## Recommended chain (Bus Textures in shimmer style).

1. **Channel EQ** (band-pass 300 Hz - 5 kHz)
    
2. **Overdrive** (Drive 3-4 dB, Tone ~4-5 kHz)
    
3. **Pitch Shifter**
    
    - Semitones: **+12** (for bright shimmer)
        
    - Mix: 100% wet
        
    - Fine Tune: 0
        
    - Latency Compensation: on "Low" (if it doesn't give you phase problems)
        
4. **ChromaVerb** (Long Hall).
    
    - Decay: 4-6 s
        
    - Pre-delay: 40 ms
        
    - High Cut: 6-7 kHz
        
    - Low Cut: 200 Hz
        
    - Mod Depth: 15-20%
        

** Result: your textures enter the bus, are saturated/darkened, then **raised an octave** and finally sent into a long Hall → typical Eno style shimmer ✨

---

-> Variant: duplicate the Textures Bus, change the Pitch Shifter to **-12 semitones** and you have a _dark shimmer_. Mix the two buses and you get a huge and "celestial/demonic" carpet at the same time.
