# **Extra-Dark textures (environmental, dirty, cinematic)**
## **Objective**
To create **dark and deep sound carpets** that fill the space between drums and harmonies, in full trip-hop/dark ambient style.

## **1. Source**
- Field recordings: wind, distant traffic, rustling.
- Noise generator (Logic: *Test Oscillator* → White/Pink noise).
- Vocal/instrumental samples rendered unrecognizable (reverse, granular).

## **2. Basic processing**
1. **Channel EQ**
	- Narrow band-pass: HPF 200-300 Hz / LPF 4-5 kHz.
	- Small boost at 500-800 Hz to give body.
1. **Bitcrusher (Logic)**
	- Resolution: 12-14 bits (not too destructive).
	- Mix: 15-20% → adds dirt without ruining everything.
1. **Overdrive / Distortion**
	- Drive: 2-3 dB
	- Tone: 2-3 kHz -> "lo-fi dark" color.

## **3. Spatiality**
- **Space Designer** → Long dark hall (5-6s, filtered 200-5k).
- **Tremolo** → Very slow rate (1/2 or 1/1), Depth 20-30%.
- Optional: **AutoPan** at very slow rate → texture moves in stereo.

## **4. Shimmer dark (optional)**
- Pitch Shifter -12 semitones → ChromaVerb Hall 6-8s.-> A tail going down an octave, super "sonic abyss".

## **5. Bus Textures Extra-Dark**.
- Put all textures in a dedicated bus.
- Light glue (Opto comp, 2:1, 2 dB GR).
- Final low-pass EQ 4-5 kHz → darken everything.

## **Final character**
- Noise and carpets that don't steal attention, but **fill in the gaps**.
- Dirty, cinematic atmosphere, perfect for ambient/dark downtempo.
- They can work even at very low volume: they *feel rather than listen*.
