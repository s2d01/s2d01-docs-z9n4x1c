# Master Bus - Ambient / Trip-Hop Style

### 1. **Channel EQ (gentle tilt)**

- Low Shelf: -1 dB below 40 Hz → cleans up excessive subs.
    
- High Shelf: -1.5 dB above 10 kHz → slightly darkens the mix (Massive Attack feel).
    
- If more presence is needed → +1 dB at 2-3 kHz.
    

---

### 2. **Multipressor (gentle glue)**

- Low band (20-120 Hz): Ratio 1.5:1, GR max 1-2 dB.
    
- Mid band (120-4k): Ratio 1.5-2:1, GR 1-2 dB.
    
- High band (4k-20k): Ratio 1.5:1, GR 0.5-1 dB.  
    ** All very light → serves only to control without crushing.
    

---

### 3. **Tape delay (stereo widener trick)**

- Delay: 1/64 L - 1/64 R
    
- Feedback: 0%
    
- Mix: 5-8%.
    ** Used not as a delay but as a "character": adds stereo micro-phases that widen the mix without chorus.
    

---

### 4. **Exciter (dark and thin)**

- Amount: 5-7%
    
- Frequency: 3-5 kHz
    ** Just a trickle of air/harmonica, just to keep the treble from collapsing too much.
    

---

### 5. **Adaptive Limiter (final glue)**

- Output Ceiling: -0.3 dB
    
- Gain: adjust to have LUFS around -12/-11 (don't push too hard, let's leave dynamic).  
    ** It is more "mixbus limiter" than final mastering.
    

---

## Final character

- Dark but deep → bass drum and snare remain in the foreground, cymbals and treble controlled.
    
- Stereo wide but not fake.
    
- Dynamics preserved (not crushed by heavy limiter).

# Master Bus - Punchy / Trip-Hop Style

### 1. **Channel EQ (character)**

- Low Shelf: +1.5 dB at 60 Hz → gives weight to kick.
    
- Light Cut -2 dB at 250 Hz → takes away mud.
    
- Boost +1 dB at 3 kHz → brings out snare and vocals.  
    ** EQ more pronounced than in ambient version.
    

---

### 2. **Compressor (Studio VCA or Vintage VCA)**

- Ratio: 2:1
    
- Attack: 20-30 ms (lets transients pass)
    
- Release: 80-120 ms (breathe on the slow trip-hop groove)
    
- Threshold: adjust to have 2-3 dB of constant GR.  
    ** Glue + light pumping, very Massive Attack style.
    

---

### 3. **Saturator (Overdrive or Tape Delay trick)**

- Use **Overdrive** with Drive 2-3 dB, Tone 6-7 kHz.  
    ** Adds analog grit, makes kit "dirtier".
    

_(or "Tape Delay" with Feedback 0%, Dry/Wet 5-10% per tape color)_

---

### 4. **Exciter**

- Amount: 10-15%.
    
- Frequency: 4-6 kHz
    ** More treble boost → makes hi-hats and rooms breathe without making them bright.
    

---

### 5. **Adaptive Limiter**

- Output Ceiling: -0.3 dB
    
- Gain: raise up to -9 / -8 LUFS if you want a modern boost (but watch out for dynamics).  
    ** Brings your mix to "club-ready" level while maintaining punch.
    

---

## Final character

- **Kick and snare in the face**, deep bass.
    
- **Dark saturation**, not bright, reminiscent of Bristolian sound.
    
- **Harsher limiter** than the ambient version, but still musical.
    

---

**Trick: You can keep **two versions of the master bus** (Ambient and Punchy) and duplicate the Output track in Logic. Bypass one or the other depending on the track, without having to redo the settings.

# Master Bus Handbook - Dark/Ambient/Trip-Hop

### EQ (Channel EQ)

- **Sub cleanup**: -1 dB @ 40 Hz (Low Shelf)
    
- **Anti-mud**: -2 dB @ 250 Hz (Medium Q, wide)
    
- **Presence (if needed)**: +1 dB @ 2-3 kHz
    
- **Dark tilt**: -1/-1.5 dB above 10 kHz (High Shelf)
    

---

### Compressor (Studio VCA / Vintage VCA)

- Ratio: **2:1**
    
- Attack: **20-30 ms** (lets transient pass)
    
- Release: **80-120 ms** (breathe with the slow groove)
    
- Threshold: adjust for **2-3 dB of Gain Reduction** on the meter
    
- Make Up Gain: just enough to compensate
    

** Soft glue, not squashed.

---

### Saturation (Overdrive or Tape Delay trick).

- Overdrive: Drive 2-3 dB, Tone 5-6 kHz
    
- Or: Tape Delay → Feedback 0%, Mix 5-10%.
    ** Adds analog grain without overdrive.
    

---

### Exciter

- Amount: 5-10%
    
- Range: 3-6 kHz
    ** A strand of harmonic air, useful to keep treble from collapsing after cuts.
    

---

### Limiter (Adaptive Limiter)

- Ceiling: -0.3 dB
    
- Gain:
    
    - **Ambient** → up to -12 / -11 LUFS (dynamic)
        
    - **Punchy** → up to -9 / -8 LUFS (more aggressive)
        

---

## Final character

- **Dark and warm**, without sharp highs.
    
- **Glue** due to light compression.
    
- **Punch** if you turn up the limiter more.
    
- **Grank** with metered saturation/exciter.
    

---

**You can keep two versions saved as **Output Channel Strip Settings**:

- _Ambient Master_ (more dynamic, less driven)
    
- _Punchy Master_ (more compression and limiter, grittier).
