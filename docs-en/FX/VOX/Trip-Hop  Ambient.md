**Trip-Hop / Ambient Style Voices**
## **Objective**
Voices **dark, enveloping, hypnotic**, which do not dominate as in pop but become part of the atmosphere.

## **1. Basic EQ**
- High Cut: 8-10 kHz (to take away pop brilliance).
- Low Cut: 100 Hz (to clean up sub).
- Soft boost at 300-500 Hz if heat is needed.

## **2. Compressor**
- Circuit: Opto (Logic's Vintage Opto)
- Ratio: 2-3:1
- Attack: medium (30 ms)
- Release: 150 ms
- Gain Reduction: 3-5 dB -> Soft compression, without pumping, so the voice remains velvety.

## **3. Delay**
- Stereo Delay:
	- L: 1/4, R: 1/8
	- Feedback: 15-20%
	- Mix: 20-25% -> Dark, rhythmic delay that "dances" behind the voice.
- Optional: 4-5 kHz low pass on return → dark delay.

## **4. Reverb**
- Medium plate (1.5-2s) dark → for presence.
- Hall long (3-4s) filtered → for ambience.-> Often two reverbs in parallel: a short one to "glue" it, a long one to float it.

## **5. Creative effects**
- **Mild distortion** (Overdrive Drive 2 dB, Tone 3-4 kHz) → gives grit.
- **Slow tremolo** (Rate 1/2, Depth 15%) → hypnotic movement.
- **Reverse reverb** on phrases → kinematic atmosphere.

## **6. Voice Bus**.
- You can create a dedicated Aux: glue VCA compressor + soft saturation.
- Generous sends to Ambient Reverbs and Textures → vocals blend with soundscape.

## **Final Character**
- Voice not "pop foreground," but **atmospheric instrument** inside the mix.
- Dark, hypnotic, with rhythmic delays and layered reverbs.
- Perfect mood for ambient, downtempo, trip-hop.

-> Even if your tracks remain instrumental, you could use this recipe for:
- filtered AI vocal phrases,
- spoken samples taken from field recordings,
- or even hum/whisper as textures.
