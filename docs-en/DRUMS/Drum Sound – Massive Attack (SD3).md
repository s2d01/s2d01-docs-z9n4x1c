**Drum Sound at Massive Attack (SD3)**

## **Objective**
Drums **dark, heavy, atmospheric**, with soft kick and dry snare, typical of 90s Bristol trip-hop (*Mezzanine*, *100th Window*).

## **1. Choosing a kit in SD3**.
- Start with a **Ludwig 70s kit** or **Gretsch** (they are already dark and full).
- Use few cymbals → dark HH, no bright crashes (or keep them but filtered).
- Watch out for **Overheads** and **Room**: they are critical, more than close-mics.

## **2. Routing in SD3**
- Kick → Direct Out (clean).
- Snare → Direct Out.
- HH and cymbals → turn it down a lot, keep it almost like "background noise".
- Room → keep it high, it will be the glue of the kit.
- Overheads → turn them down and filter out the highs, so they stay dark.

## **3. Processing in Logic**
**Kick**
- EQ: cut 250 Hz (-3 dB), boost to 60-70 Hz (+3 dB) → sub soft.
- Slow compressor (30-40 ms attack) → let breathe.
**Snare**
- EQ: low cut 150 Hz, boost 200 Hz (+2 dB body), slight +3 dB at 2-3 kHz (snap).
- Light saturation (Overdrive or Tape Delay trick).
**Hi-Hat / Cymbals**
- EQ: low pass 8-10 kHz → no brightness.
- Short delay (1/16, low feedback) for movement.
**Room**
- Aggressive compressor (FET 1176 style, 8:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release) → characteristic "pump".
- EQ: High cut 6 kHz for darkening.

## **4. Bus Drums Processing**
- Parallel compression ("Super Punchy") → adds body and aggression.
- Room + Overhead dark → mix it with the main bus.
- Some dark ambient reverb (2-3 s, filtered).

## **Final character**
- Deep, dark kick.
- Dry snare, with character but not bright.
- Compressed room that becomes part of the groove.
- Cymbals almost hidden, only as texture.
- Dark, hypnotic atmosphere → *Massive Attack mood*.
