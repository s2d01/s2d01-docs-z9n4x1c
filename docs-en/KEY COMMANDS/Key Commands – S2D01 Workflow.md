# Key Commands - S2D01 Workflow


You can assign custom **Key Commands** (Logic → Key Commands → Edit):

- "Create New Aux Channel Strip" → put a key of your choice (like F5).
    
- "Bypass All Plug-ins on Selected Channel Strips" → put F6.
    

-> Like this:

- press **F5** → Aux again ready to load an FX.
    
- press **F6** → Aux selected mutated in one shot (Light mode).

### FX Bus Management

- **F5** → Create New Aux Channel Strip.
    _(add an FX bus now, to go from Light to Full)_
    
- **F6** → Bypass All Plug-ins on Selected Channel Strips.
    _(take your FX buses offline = Light mode)_
    
- **F7** → Delete Selected Channel Strips.
    _(if you want to clean the mixer from the unused Auxes)_

### Send Management

- **⌥Click** on Send knob → reset to -∞
    
- **Shift+⌥Drag** → copy the same send level to multiple tracks.  
    -> Use it to send the whole Drum Stack together to an FX bus.

### Mix / Bus Control

- **Ctrl+⌘+↑ / ↓** → Quickly switch between Input/Bus/Output in the Mixer.  
    
- **F8** → Toggle Bypass Sends (you can assign it).
    _(turns you off/on all sends of a track → Instant Light/Full)._
