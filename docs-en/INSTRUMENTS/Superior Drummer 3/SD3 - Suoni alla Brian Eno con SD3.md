# Ambient Kit / Brian Eno with your SD3/EZX libraries.

### 1. **Kick (subtle pulse)**

- Use a soft kick from **DreamPop** or **Post-Rock** → no attack, just body.
    
- EQ: low pass at 150 Hz → only the "pulse" remains.  
    -> Must sound more like a "breath" than a drum beat.

### 2. **Snare / Rim / Texture**

- Get a **dry **rimshot** from **EZX2_Reggae** or a small snare from **DreamPop**.
    
- EQ: filter everything above 6-7 kHz → darkest.
    
- Process with **long reverb (4-6s, filtered)** and dark ping-pong delay.  
    -> Becomes an "atmospheric event," not a groove snare.

### 3. **Hi-Hats & Cymbals**

- Use very soft HH from **Jazz** or **DreamPop**.
    
- High Cut: 6-7 kHz → no shine.
    
- Optional: insert a very short stereo delay (10-15 ms) → wide whisper effect.  
    -> They must sound like ambient rustles.

### 4. **Creative percussions**

- **EZX Percussion**: get shakers, drums, small hand percussion.
    
- Apply **slow tremolo** (1/2, Depth 30%) → hypnotic pulse.
    
- Send in **Textures Bus shimmer -12 semitones** → become "sub-aquatic" sounds.

### 5. **Room & Ambience**

- **HansaRooms** → use large rooms, long decay.
    
- Compressed slightly (VCA 2:1, GR 1-2 dB).
    
- High Cut 5 kHz to darken.  
    -> Here Room is more important than the drums themselves.

### 6. **Bus Drums Ambient**

- EQ: cuts below 80 Hz (leaves the synthetic bass the space).
    
- Comp Opto soft (2:1 ratio, GR 2 dB).
    
- Massive send to your **Reverbs Ambient** and **Textures Extra-Dark** buses.

### Final Character

- Barely perceptible kick → pulse rather than rhythm.
    
- Snare/perc. transformed into spatial events.
    
- Hi-hat become filtered swooshes.
    
- Giant, dark, enveloping room.  
    
    -> Result = **atmospheric instrument** more than "drums," perfect for ambient/drone/ethereal downtempo.
