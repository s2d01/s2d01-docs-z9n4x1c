# Workflow: Recall Kits in SD3

### 1. Build the kit.

- Choose the instruments (kick/snare/room/perc) from the libraries.
    
- Set levels and routing in SD3's **internal mixer** (assign multiple outputs if needed).
    
- Apply minimal EQ/Comp already if you want, or leave it clean and process in Logic.

### 2. Save as **Mixer Preset**.

- Go to the **Mixer** in SD3.
    
- Top right menu → **Save Mixer Preset As...**.
    
- Example name:
    
    - `S2D01 Massive Attack Kit`.
        
    - `S2D01 Ambient Eno Kit`
        -> So you save routing, levels, any internal effects.
        

---

### 3. (Optional) Also save as **User Preset Kit**.

- Go to the SD3 main menu (loaded instruments).
    
- **Save As... → User Preset**.  
    -> This saves not only the mixer but also the choice of drums themselves.

### 4. Use the **Song Track**

- In the **Song Track** you can put a MIDI groove (even a trivial one).
    
- Associate a kit → so you have a preview of the sound right away.
    
- You can also save here as a **Song Track Preset** (so you recall kit + groove).

# Practical workflow for you

- If you only want **sounds** → save as **Mixer Preset** and **User Preset Kit**.
    
- If you want a ready to "play" kit with a groove → save as **Song Track Preset**.
    

-> This way in 2 clicks you can switch between:

- _S2D01 Massive Attack Kit_.
    
- _S2D01 Ambient Eno Kit_
    

...without rebuilding anything from scratch
