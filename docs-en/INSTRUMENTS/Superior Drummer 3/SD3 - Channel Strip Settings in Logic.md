# Channel Strip Settings organization in Logic

Path where they end:

```
~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Channel Strip Settings/
```

Inside you will find subfolders **Audio**, **Bus**, **Instrument**, **Output**.  
You will mostly use **Bus** (for FX) and **Output** (for Master).

## Recommended structure

### DRUMS (Aux / Bus)

Folder: `S2D01 Drums`

- `S2D01_Parallel_Punchy`
    
- `S2D01_Parallel_AmbientDark`
    
- `S2D01_Parallel_ElectroModern`
    
- `S2D01_DrumsBus_Ambient`
    
- `S2D01_DrumsBus_Punchy`
    

---

### FX BUS

Folder: `S2D01 FX Bus`

- `S2D01_Reverbs_Ambient`
    
- `S2D01_Textures_Shimmer`
    

---

### FX TEXTURE

Folder: `S2D01 FX Texture`

- `S2D01_Texture_ExtraDark`
    

---

### X VOX

Folder: `S2D01 FX Vox`

- `S2D01_Vox_TripHopAmbient`
    

---

### FX MASTER (Output)

Folder: `S2D01 Master`

- `S2D01_Master_Ambient`
    
- `S2D01_Master_Punchy`
    

---

# Rule of thumb

- Always prefix **S2D01_** → your settings appear immediately at the top of Logic's menus.
    
- Name **compact but descriptive** (Bus / Texture / Vox / Master).
    
- Same nomenclature you use in SD3 → so you don't get confused between the two worlds.
    

---

-> Result: when you open Logic or SD3 you have **the same mental scheme of folders and names**, and you recall everything in one click without wasting time.
