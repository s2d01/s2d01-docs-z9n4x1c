# Massive Attack Kit

### 1. **Kick (fundamental)**

- Basic: **EZX2_HipHop** → choose a dark, round, no-click kick.
    
- Layer: **DreamPop kick** → adds soft body.
    
- Processing in Logic:
    
    - EQ: boost at 60 Hz (+3 dB), cut at 250 Hz (-2/3 dB).
        
    - Slow comp (attack 30 ms, release 100 ms).
        
    - If you want electronic beat → add a sub-kick from the **EZX_Electronic**, filtered LPF 100 Hz.

### 2. **Snare**

- Base: **DreamPop snare** → velvety, dark.
    
- Layer: dry clap/snare from the **EZX2_HipHop** → only on the highs (HPF 800 Hz).
    
- Optional: a rimshot from **EZX2_Reggae** for "dub" color.
    
- Processing in Logic:
    
    - EQ: low cut 120 Hz, boost 200 Hz (+2 dB), presence +3 dB at 2.5-3 kHz.
        
    - Light saturation (Overdrive Drive 2 dB).
        
    - Room: sends snare into the Room of **HansaRooms** → loud compression (trip-hop style pump).

### 3. **Hi-Hat & Cymbals**

- Get HH from **DreamPop** or **HipHop** → turn down volume, high cut 8-9 kHz.
    
- Overheads → almost nothing.
    
- Processing: short ping-pong delay (1/16), low feedback.

### 4. **Room & Ambience**

- Use **HansaRooms** → one of the large rooms.
    
- Raise the Room more than the norm (it becomes part of the sound).
    
- Compressor FET 1176, ratio 8:1, fast attack, medium release → pump.
    
- High Cut 6 kHz to keep it dark.

### 5. **Extra percussions**

- Add from **EZX Percussion** (dark shaker, filtered drum).
    
- Treat them with slow tremolo or tape delay → hypnotic groove.
    

---

### 6. **Bus Drums Processing**

- Glue Comp (VCA, ratio 2:1, attack 30 ms, release 100 ms, GR 2-3 dB).
    
- Parallel Punch (see your Saturn/1176 chain).
    
- Send to your **Reverbs Ambient** and **Textures Shimmer** buses to put them in the space.

### Final Character

- Deep, dark kick with electronic sub underneath.
    
- Velvety snare + dry clap → hypnotic groove.
    
- Hi-hat filtered, almost hidden.
    
- Compressed room that "breathes."
    
- Minimal percussion pulsing.  
    
    -> Result = **Massive Attack style** without buying more libraries.
