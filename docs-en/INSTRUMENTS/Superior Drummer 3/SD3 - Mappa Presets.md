# General rules

- **Prefix S2D01_** = your presets always stay at the top of the lists.
    
- **Same nomenclature** in SD3 and Logic → zero confusion.
    
- Folders divided by function (Drums, FX Bus, FX Texture, FX Vox, Master).
    
- Update them as we add new "recipes".

-> So you have a real **nice **ecosystem**: SD3 and Logic speak the same language, and you recall any chain/kit in 2 clicks.
