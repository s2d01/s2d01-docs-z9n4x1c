# Organization Preset SD3 (recommended)

### Main folder

- **S2D01 Custom Kits**
    -> all your user presets inside a folder with the project name → distinguish them immediately from Toontrack presets.
    

---

### Inside the folder

- **Massive Attack Style**
    
    - `S2D01_MassiveAttack_Kit` (User Preset → tools + routing)
        
    - `S2D01_MassiveAttack_Mixer` (Mixer Preset → levels, EQ, out)
        
- **Ambient / Eno Style**
    
    - `S2D01_AmbientEno_Kit`
        
    - `S2D01_AmbientEno_Mixer`
        

---

### Future variants (if you make more recipes).

- `S2D01_PunchyRock_Kit`
    
- `S2D01_TripHopHybrid_Kit`
    
- etc.

# Practical workflow

1. **Always create a "Kit" preset and a "Mixer "** → so you can recall just the drums or just the routing/FX.
    
2. **Prefix S2D01_** in front → your presets always stay at the top of the list.
    
3. Use **descriptive but short names**: _MassiveAttack_, _AmbientEno_, _Hybrid_...
    

---

-> So inside SD3 you get a _S2D01 Custom Kits_ folder with 2-3 clear presets in it → load what you need on the fly without searching through the Toontrack welter.

Perfect!!! So you have **SD3 and Logic synchronized in the same mental order** → less chaos, more speed.
