# **Creative workflow with audio bounces**
## **1. Capture the moment**
- Let Harmonial Binauris run until something comes out that inspires you.
- Make *Bounce in Place* right away.
- Don't overthink it: accumulate lots of audio "clips," even short ones. It's like sampling your own synth.

## **2. Chopping and re-arranging**
- Cut bounces into chunks (even 1/4 or 1/8 of a beat).
- Rearrange the fragments to create new patterns, kind of like with a sampler.
- If you want, use **Strip Silence** in Logic to have it help you automatically separate notes.

## **3. Time-stretching & Flex**
- Enable **Flex Time** (Polyphonic or Slicing).
- Stretch or tighten the fragments to match the groove of the song.
- You can also get very interesting glitch and stutter effects.

## **4. Layering**
- Duplicate the same clip and transpose it ±12 semitones.
- Pan wide L/R → get spatial textures.
- Or duplicate and process differently (one with reverb, the other with distortion).

## **5. Granulation & glitches**
- Load bounces into a granular plugin (e.g. *Alchemy* which is already inside Logic).
- Turn patterns into atmospheric pads, alien sounds or cinematic drones.

## **6. Infinite resampling**
- When you have created an interesting layer, do **Bounce in Place** again.
- Then repeat: cut, transpose, stretch →new still different material.
- It's like building an archive of original samples just your own.

-> Basically, Harmonial becomes your **machine of surprises**, and with audio bounces you turn it into a real *personal sample library*.
Do you want me to make you a **quick map with key Logic commands** (like shortcuts for bounce, flex, strip silence, etc.), so you have the creative flow always at your fingertips?
