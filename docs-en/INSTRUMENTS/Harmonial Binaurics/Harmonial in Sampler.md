**Workflow - From Bounce to Sampler**
## **1. Prepare Samples**
- Use **Bounce in Place** to generate your fragments from Harmonial.
- Cut the samples into individual notes or loops (even micro-loops if you want "grainy" sounds).
- Save them all in a dedicated folder (e.g. *Harmonial Samples*).

## **2. Create a new Sampler**
1. Add a **new software instrument track**.
2. In the Channel Strip load **Sampler**.
3. The Sampler window opens.

## **3. Import samples**
- Drag your audio files directly into the Sampler window.
- Logic will ask you how to map:
	- **Chromatic Mapping** → puts each sample on a different, consecutive note.
	- **Optimized Mapping** → try to infer the original note (if there is pitch info in the file).
	- **One Shot** → useful if you want to trigger loops or single shots.

## **4. Editing in the Sampler**
- Adjust **Start/End** to cut each sample well.
- Set **Loop** if you want a sample to keep running.
- Use the **Envelopes** (ADSR) to shape attack and release.
- Play with **Filter**, **Pitch** and **Modulation** to transform the sound.

## **5. Save the instrument**
- From the Sampler menu choose **Save As...** and give it a name (e.g., *Harmonial Kit 01*).
- Now you can always find it in your Sampler library.

💡 **Creative Tip:** You can create a real **atonal drum kit** by putting Harmonial patterns or glitches on multiple keys, so you can "play" the fragments as if it were an MPC.


**Kit 8 Samples in Logic Sampler**
## **1. Set up the samples**
- Bounce 8 different fragments (e.g., glitches, loops, single notes) from Harmonial.
- Save them in a folder (e.g. *Harmonial Kit 01*).
- Ideally name the files in order: Sample01.wav ... Sample08.wav.

## **2. Create the Sampler track**
1. Add **new software instrument track**.
2. Load **Sampler** as an instrument.

## **3. Import samples**
1. Open the Sampler window.
2. Drag in the 8 samples.
3. In the mapping window, choose **Zone per sample**.
4. Place each sample on a precise MIDI key (e.g. **C1 to G1**).

## **4. Map manually (if needed)**
- Go to the **Zone/Mapping view**.
- Assign each sample to a single note (range = 1 note).
	- Sample01 → C1
	- Sample02 → C#1
	- ...
	- Sample08 → G1

## **5. Optimize**
- For each sample, set **One Shot** (so you hear the whole sample when you press the button).
- If you want to loop, turn on **Loop Mode**.
- Adjust ADSR: short attack, medium release to avoid clicks.

## **6. Save the Kit**.
- From the Sampler menu → **Save As...** → *Harmonial Kit 01*.
- Now you will find it in the Sampler library always ready.

-> **Extra Tip:** You can duplicate the Sampler track and load 8 more samples → so you create *Harmonial Kit 02, 03...*, each with different sounds to play live on the keyboard.
