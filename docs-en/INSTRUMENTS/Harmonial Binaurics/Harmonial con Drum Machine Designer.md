**Harmonial Kit in Drum Machine Designer**
## **1. Create Drum Machine Designer track**
1. Go to **Track → New instrument software track**.
2. Choose **Drum Machine Designer** as the instrument.
3. A blank kit with 16 pads opens.

## **2. Load the samples**
- Drags audio bounces (those exported from Harmonial) **directly to DMD's pads**.
- Each pad hosts an instance of **Quick Sampler** automatically.
- Now you already have the samples mapped to the pads!

## **3. Configure the pads**
- Click on a pad → Quick Sampler opens.
- Set **Mode = One Shot** (perfect for single shots).
- If the sample is a loop, you can choose **Slice** or **Classic** for more control.
- Adjust start/end points, pitch and filters for each sample.

## **4. Playing with pads**
- If you have a MIDI controller with pads (like MPK Mini, Launchpad, Push, etc.), Logic will map the DMD pads automatically to your corresponding MIDI keys (usually C1 → first pad).
- Otherwise you can play them from your regular MIDI keyboard: the samples are chromatically mapped from the C1 keys on up.

## **5. Save the kit**.
- When you are satisfied, go to **File → Save as Patch...**.
- Give it a name (e.g. *Harmonial DMD Kit 01*).
- You will now find it in the Drum Kits library.

-> **Creative **Tip: You can mix Harmonial bounces with traditional drum hits → e.g., regular kick and snare + Harmonial glitches on other pads. You will have a very original hybrid kit!

Do you want me to make you a **chart-like graphic pad map (4x4)** with an idea of how to arrange Harmonial samples (e.g., glitch on top, bass on the bottom, textures on the sides)?
